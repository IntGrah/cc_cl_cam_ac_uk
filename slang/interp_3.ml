 Note that we could have

         @ [LABEL h; bind x ] @ c1 @ [SWAP; POP; RETURN]

    code = [MK_CLOSURE((h, None)); [MK_CLOSURE((g, None)); APPLY]

  where g and h are new labels.

  In contrast, the following version of comp results in

     defs = [LABEL f; BIND x] @ c1 @ [SWAP; POP; RETURN]

     code = [MK_CLOSURE((f, None)); BIND f] @ c2 @ [SWAP; POP])

  which is simpler.
